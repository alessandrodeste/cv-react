# cv-react

This is a small playground I've used to have fun with react and webpack.

## How to use

Install packages

```bash
npm install
```

Edit your /assets/resume.json

Run application with webpack-dev-server

```bash
npm run start
```

## Todo

- Add missing areas (volunteer, education, awards...)
- Upgrade to webpack2

## Note about JSON resume

I liked the idea of [JSON resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) but you will find some differences from the original schema.

Examples:

- basics.yearOfBirth
- basics.location.map
- basics.downloads
- greetings
